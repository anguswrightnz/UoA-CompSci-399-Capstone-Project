# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

OTTER: Online TMS Training Experience Reboot

## A link to your Project Management tool.

## A short description of what the project is about. (You may put a link to your final report here, after it has been completed).
This project was created as a website for VERIFY in order to train clinicians on TMS. Previously, Google Forms were used by the clients but it proved to be hard to manage clinicians individually and providing feedback after questions were submitted. 
Our website ___(idk the appropriate word) paid features needed for Google Forms and allows individual informative feedback for each question based on practice or final quizzes. Admins are able to change questions and feedback with ease from their dashboard, along with other features such as managing clinician information and other admins with approval. Clinicians have an one time pre-survey which would save their information for the future and have their own profile. An easy login is provided for clinicians to suit their busy lifestyle, taking them directly to continue with their quizzes. 


## Technologies that are used to build the project (include the languages used, the libraries and their versions).
ASP.NET
.NET8 in C# with Visual Studio 2022
SQL database using EntityFramework ORM
Swagger for API endpoints.
Javascript React  in Visual Studio Code
Figma to design
Uizard wireframe
Amazon AWS services with their Elastic Beanstalk tool.

## Usage Examples (if available).

## URL of the website where the project has been deployed (if applicable).
https://www.tmstrainingquizzes.com/home

## Future Plan (Ideas for future releases)
-Add option for drag and drop along with short/long answers for quiz questions. 
-AI marking for text answers could be used to reduce workload on admins with an option to contact an admin for remarking if clinician feels the AI is wrong. 
-Better scaling for smaller devices.
-Ablility to recall answers from previous attempts.
-Reminder email to clinicians to remind them to recertify.

## Acknowledgements (if any) - You can list tutorials used, projects referred to, people consulted etc.
